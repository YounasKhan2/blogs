# Design Thinking Process

## Core Principles
The design thinking process follows [[Human-Centered Design]] 
principles and consists of five stages:

1. [[Empathize]] - Understanding user needs
2. [[Define]] - Framing the problem
3. [[Ideate]] - Generating solutions
4. [[Prototype]] - Building testable versions
5. [[Test]] - Validating solutions

## Related Concepts
- [[Design Sprint Methodology]]
- [[User Experience Research]]
- [[Agile Development]]

```

## Knowledge Management and Organization

### Notion's Database-Driven Approach

**Relational Databases:**
- **Properties** with various types (text, number, date, relation)
- **Views** (table, gallery, calendar, timeline, board)
- **Filters and sorting** for dynamic content organization
- **Formulas** for calculated fields
- **Rollups** for aggregating related data

**Use Case Example - Content Calendar:**

**Database Structure:**
```
Content Calendar Database:
- Title (Title)
- Status (Select: Draft, Review, Scheduled, Published)
- Author (Person)
- Publish Date (Date)
- Content Type (Multi-select: Blog, Video, Social)
- Keywords (Multi-select)
- Performance Metrics (Number)
```

**Multiple Views:**
- **Calendar view** for visual scheduling
- **Kanban board** grouped by status
- **Table view** for detailed editing
- **Gallery view** for visual content overview

### Obsidian's Graph-Based Knowledge Management

**Bidirectional Linking:**
- **Automatic backlinks** show all pages mentioning current note
- **Graph database** builds automatically from links
- **Link suggestions** based on similar content
- **Orphaned notes** identification for better connections

**Knowledge Graph Features:**
- **Global graph** showing entire knowledge network
- **Local graph** focused on current note's connections
- **Graph filters** by tags, folders, or link types
- **Graph styling** for visual customization

**Zettelkasten Implementation:**
```
Personal Knowledge Management System:

📁 Inbox/           (New, unprocessed notes)
📁 Literature/      (Notes from books, articles)
📁 Permanent/       (Refined, connected insights)
📁 Projects/        (Active work and research)
📁 Archive/         (Completed or inactive notes)

Example connections:
[[Creativity]] ↔ [[Design Thinking]] ↔ [[Innovation]]
      ↓                    ↓                 ↓
[[Brainstorming]]  [[User Research]]  [[Entrepreneurship]]
```
