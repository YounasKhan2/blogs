5. **Verify both sticks are fully seated** - should be level

#### **Install M.2 SSD:**
1. **Locate M.2 slot** on motherboard (check manual)
2. **Remove mounting screw** at end of slot
3. **Insert SSD at 30-degree angle** and press down
4. **Secure with screw** - finger-tight only

### **Step 2: Install CPU Cooler (20 minutes)**

#### **For AMD Wraith Cooler:**
1. **Apply thermal paste** if not pre-applied (rice grain sized amount)
2. **Position cooler** over CPU with AMD logo right-side up
3. **Hook clips onto mounting brackets** on motherboard
4. **Press down lever** until it locks in place
5. **Connect fan cable** to CPU_FAN header on motherboard

#### **For Third-Party Coolers:**
1. **Remove stock mounting hardware** from motherboard
2. **Install new mounting brackets** per cooler instructions
3. **Apply thermal paste** to CPU (if not pre-applied on cooler)
4. **Mount cooler** according to specific instructions
5. **Tighten screws** in X pattern, gradually increasing pressure

### **Step 3: Prepare the Case (25 minutes)**

#### **Remove Side Panels:**
1. **Remove both side panels** from case (usually thumb screws)
2. **Remove I/O shield** placeholder if present
3. **Install motherboard I/O shield** - push firmly until all edges click
4. **Install motherboard standoffs** in correct positions (usually pre-installed)

#### **Install Power Supply:**
1. **Orient PSU fan** downward if case has bottom vents
2. **Slide PSU into case** with cables facing inside
3. **Secure with four screws** from outside back of case
4. **Connect main 24-pin power** to motherboard
